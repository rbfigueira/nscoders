NSCoders
========

NSCoders will act as a colaboration project between a group of people. The goal, besides creating an application, is to learn/enhance (at least) two things:

* iOS and objective-c
* Collaboration off-shore

The idea itself, in a nutshell, is to allow a person to search for a developer. Imagine the case where I, as a recruiter, need to find an iOS Developer. How can I do it? This application will try to satisfy this need.
